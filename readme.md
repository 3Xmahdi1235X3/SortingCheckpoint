Insertion Sort Algorithm
Description
This repository contains an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm in [programming language]. Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly moving elements one at a time from the unsorted part of the array to its correct position in the sorted part of the array.

How it Works
Insertion Sort works by iterating through the array, taking one element at a time, and inserting it into its correct position within the already sorted part of the array. The algorithm continues this process until the entire array is sorted.
